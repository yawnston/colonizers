## Colonizers - a board game  simulation

Colonizers is a board game about colonizing Mars. A very valuable element called Omnium was found below Mars' surface, and now various corporations, adventurers and opportunists are rushing to get their share.

This project contains the simulation core, along with three interfaces for its use:

 - Command-line interactive program designed for human interaction
 - Program which interfaces with Python AI code directly, allowing it to play the game
 - Server allowing you to play the game over the internet
