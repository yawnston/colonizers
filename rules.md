## Game rules

The game is played by four players taking turns. The game's currency is Omnium, the newly found valuable element. The game's main building blocks are Modules, augmentations to the player's colony. A player can choose to build a Module, but he must pay its cost in Omnium. Each player also controls a Colonist, who is an extraordinary fortune-seeker, lending the player various powerful abilities.

**Game structure**
The game is composed of rounds, and each round is composed of players taking turns. Each round, every player picks a Colonist to control that round, and they may then acquire resources, use the Colonists' special abilities, and build Modules in their colony.

**Game start**
At the start of the game, all Modules start in a deck. Each player starts with an empty hand and no Omnium. Players start with no Colonists assigned, all available colonists are in a separate Colonist deck.

**One round**
At the start of each round, first every player chooses a Colonist. This means that all playable Colonists are gathered into the Colonist deck, the deck is shuffled and the top Colonist is secretly removed from play (as in, the players do not get to know which colonist has been removed). They then each pick a Colonist from the remaining Colonists, in the order of first player to last. 

Then, players will take turns, from first to last. The round ends when the last player's turn ends.

**One turn**
At the start of a player's turn, the player may choose to either spend their time gathering Omnium (receiving 2 Omnium), or researching new Modules to use in their colony (drawing 2 Modules from the deck, keeping one in the hand and putting the other back at the bottom of the deck). The player may not research new modules if their hand is already full (5 modules).

Then, the player may use their Colonist's special active ability, if their colonist has one. Even if their Colonist has a special ability, the player may choose to not use it. Passive abilities are automatically used at this time.

Lastly, a player may choose to build a Module from their hand, constructing it in their colony. To build a module, the player must pay its cost in Omnium. The module is them placed from that player's hand to their colony. Contents of a player's hand are secret to other players, but each player can see everyone else's colonies.

**Game end**
The game ends at the end of a turn, during which a player's colony reached 8 Modules. At the end of that turn, value of each player's colony is calculated as a sum of values of the modules contained within. The player with the most valuable colony wins. The first player to construct 8 Modules in their Colony receives an extra 4 points for their colony's value, and all other players who also construct 8 Modules in their colony (but were not the first to do so) receive 2 points.

The game can also end with a draw if the Module deck is exhausted, though this is very uncommon in regular play.

**Colonists**

 - **Opportunist -** may choose to steal up to 2 Omnium from another Colonist during his turn. If no player controls the target Colonist , this ability has no effect.
 - **Ecologist -** gains 1 extra Omnium at the start of his turn for each Green Module in his colony.
 - **Miner -** gains 1 extra Omnium at the start of his turn for each Blue Module in his colony.
 - **General -** gains 1 extra Omnium at the start of his turn for each Red Module in his colony.
 - **Visionary -** draws 1 extra Module at the start of his turn if his hand is not full.
 - **Spy -** may choose to swap hands with another Colonist during his turn. If no player controls the target Colonist, this ability has no effect.
